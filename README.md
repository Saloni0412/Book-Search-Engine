The Book Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books using keywords and view search results from the Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.  The application provides a user-friendly interface with a simple menu and search functionality to make it easy for users to find and manage their favorite books.
